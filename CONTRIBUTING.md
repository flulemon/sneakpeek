## Contributing

1. File an issue to notify the maintainers about what you're working on.
2. Fork the repo, develop and test your code changes, add docs.
3. Make sure that your commit messages clearly describe the changes.
4. Send a pull request.

## File an Issue

Use the issue tracker to start the discussion. It is possible that someone
else is already working on your idea, your approach is not quite right, or that
the functionality exists already. The ticket you file in the issue tracker will
be used to hash that all out.

## Running tests, building package and docs

Use the issue tracker to start the discussion. It is possible that someone
else is already working on your idea, your approach is not quite right, or that
the functionality exists already. The ticket you file in the issue tracker will
be used to hash that all out.

## Make the Pull Request

Once you have made all your changes, tests, and updated the documentation, run the tests and build the package:

```
make test
make build
```

Once everything succeeds make a pull request to move everything back into the main branch of the
`repository`.

Be sure to reference the original issue in the pull request.
Expect some back-and-forth with regards to style and compliance of these
rules.
